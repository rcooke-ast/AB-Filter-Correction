# The format of this file is a CSV file with the above columns:
#
# Folder = the folder (inside the filters/ folder) where you have stored the filter response files
# Filter Response Filename = the name of the filter response file
# Photometry Catalogue = the name of the photometry catalogue file (e.g. CookeSuzukiProchaska.csv) where you have stored the photometric information
# Photometry = the name of the column in the photometry catalogue that contains the photometric values
# Photometry Error = the name of the column in the photometry catalogue that contains the photometric errors
# MagType = 0 for AB magnitudes, 1 for GALEX FUV magnitudes, 2 for GALEX NUV magnitudes
